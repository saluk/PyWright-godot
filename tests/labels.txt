TODO This doesn't actually function well, because of the main arrow button macros also including labels

"goto the label and keep going to it"

label thelabel
"starting over"
"{$_currentlabel} should be 'thelabel'"

label passedlabel
"{$_currentlabel} should be 'thelabel'"
"{$script._lastlabel} should be 'passedlabel'"

goto $_currentlabel
