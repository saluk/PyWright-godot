This is done, but lets keep this document as a reference to refer to how things work

1. keep track of all cross exam data internally when we process a script (for ONE cross)
    (we can't resume a different cross than the last one, and we can't navigate
    statements between crosses)
    cross:
        line_start
        line_end (because pywright works just fine without an end, this may be moot - maybe we dont even track this)
                (although endcross can allow you to clearly switch to a new cross)
                (although we could also just call line_end where the next cross happens)
                (clearcross can help to remove the cross exam information)
        `currentcross` = -1 or line_num
2. keep track of all statements we process while there is an active cross
    - these can be stored on the current cross object
    - for saved games, we should use variables as a source of truth
    [statementA, statementB]
    statementB is the last statement we saw
    statement:
        line number of statement command
3. when right is pressed: keep processing the script forward linearlly
    track when we have crossed a statement line and add that statement to the statement_stack
    show right arrow if we are in a statement
4. when left is pressed: jump to the last statement in the stack and rewind the stack:
    [statementA, statementB] -> [statementA], goto statementA
    show left arrow if we are in a statement, and there is a statement stack
5. resume:
    jump to the last statement in the stack
6. clearcross:
    clear ALL cross variables, even the cross object
7. endcross:
    clear the statement stack
