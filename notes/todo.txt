clean up
when changing the game dir, save the game dir in user directory

compatibility
bloop noise on continue text
change _process to _physics_process where applicable
when penalty object was made with default name evidence_menu, it conflicted with present command. WHY!?
testimony blinker should be added for cross exams automatically
cut off known extensions when searching for files, because the engine adds the extension (we already handle .png)

future
music: multiple music channels
music/sfx: able to cancel a playing sound/music
temporarily change resolution?
